# Web Logos

WIP

New logos for the Web: HTML, CSS & JS

## Idea

- Have unified logos for the web, for at least HTML, CSS & JS
- Not the old shield designs from HTML5 & CSS3 anymore - maybe use the (background) colors though
- Like the JS-logo?
  - CSS: diagonal from the top left, because cascading! the last S perfectly matching the S in the JS version
    ```
    C
      S
        S
    ```
    kinda like that â†‘ but closer together, more legible.  
    alluding to the idea of versions numbers somwhere, optionally top right space for a tiny L3, L4, L5, L6 (for the individual specs)
  - HTML: use fixed width font and spread it?
    ```
    H T
    M L
    ```
    or just use `<>`? (`{}` for CSS then?)
- Alternative idea: the shields but with "H", "C" and "J"?
- The building bricks idea from webassembly is nice
- So meta: Do the logos on the web and "only" export to SVG B-)

## Versions?

- No border radius
- Border radius
  - Like TS, per size?
  - Maybe like DevTools in one SVG using media queries
- Dark mode for sure!
- Maybe optionally (tiny) version numbers somewhere, like L5 (for CSS level 5) or the year for JS?
